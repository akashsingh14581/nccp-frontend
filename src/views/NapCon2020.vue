        <p>
          22nd NAPCON 2020, the 22nd Joint National Conference of Pulmonary
          Diseases of the National College of Chest Physicians (India) and
          Indian Chest Society was organized for the very first time as a
          virtual conference due to the prevailing situation caused by COVID-19.
          The virtual conclave was planned as a five-day event from 27th to 31st
          January 2021 under the leadership of Dr. S. N. Gaur as Organising
          Chairman and Dr. Nikhil Sarangdhar as Organising Secretary. Dr. S. K.
          Katiyar was nominated as the Chairman, Scientific Committee and
          entrusted with the task of drafting a state-of-the-art scientific
          programme for the virtual conclave.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though time was short, having less than 5 months to go, the Organising
          Committee with the support and goodwill of the national leadership of
          NCCP(I) and ICS began preparations in right earnest. The theme
          "Preparing Together for a Better Future" was selected for virtual
          NAPCON 2020, with the objective to design a spectacular scientific and
          workshop programme, rich in academic content, exceptional in diversity
          and expertise of faculty and designed to change the perspective of
          day-to-day-clinical practice in the field of Pulmonary Medicine in
          this era of COVID-19. The first announcement brochure was released on
          8th October and the website with online registration became
          operational on 10th October 2020. NAPCON 2020 website became highly
          popular within a short span of time, recording more than 10000
          visitors within two months and subsequently social media presence with
          pages on Facebook and Linked In also became operational. A sponsor
          brochure for industry participation was released on 29th October and a
          final brochure with complete scientific and workshop programmes was
          released on 28th December 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though organised differently, for the very first time as an entirely
          virtual conference, the response to NAPCON 2020 from the pulmonary
          fraternity and post-graduates was unexpected and overwhelming. A total
          of 4321 delegates registered for the conference. 1002 abstracts were
          submitted for presentation at NAPCON 2020, out of which 9 were
          selected for Oral presentation in the NCCP(I) - Prof. Dr. S. N. Gaur
          Young Scientist Award, 8 for ICS - Dr. J. C. Kothari Young Scientist
          Award and 350 for twelve different categories of NAPCON 2020 Award
          (Oral Paper) sessions, and the remaining 635 were selected for display
          as E-Posters in twelve different categories for NAPCON 2020 Award
          (E-Poster) in the Virtual E-Poster Gallery. Competitions like the
          NCCP(I) – NAPCON Post-Graduate Quiz and Talent Hunt were organised
          under the banner of NAPCON 2020 for delegates and post-graduates to
          encourage participation in academic as well as extra-curricular
          activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          A unique 3-D virtual platform was designed under supervision of
          Organising Committee for virtual NAPCON 2020 after four months of
          preparation and demonstration which went online just prior to
          conference commencement. The platform had several new features such as
          a virtual convention centre entry and walkthrough, separate lobby for
          conference and workshop, 7 halls for the scientific programme and free
          papers, E-poster gallery with separate displays for posters
          categorized into twelve different categories of respiratory diseases,
          Virtual Delegate E-kit, entertainment zone, networking lounge, and
          exhibition. The attractive design, layout and novel features of the
          virtual platform were highly appreciated by all national and overseas
          delegates, faculty and post-graduates alike. The Virtual Delegate
          E-kit incorporated the NAPCON E-Souvenir as a digital flipbook with
          sound, NCCP(I) text book on Clinical Pearls in Respiratory Medicine
          for the post-graduates, membership benefits and enrolment forms of
          both NCCP(I) and ICS, NCCP(I) Newsletter Lung Bulletin based on
          Pulmonary function tests, ICS Newsletter Respire and other
          publications of academic value. An entertainment zone with more than
          370 online games provided opportunity for relaxation and refreshment
          from time to time. A delegate-cum-snack kit was dispatched personally
          by courier on a first-come-first-served basis to the address of
          registered delegates .
